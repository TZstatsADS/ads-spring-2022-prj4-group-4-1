+ Project summary: This project explores two different methods for fairness in ML. A1 refers to LFR (Learning fair representations) and A6 refers to Local Massaging/Local Preferential Sampling. Our implementation for each algorithm can be found under the doc folder. For each of these algorithms, the algorithms were run on a COMPAS dataset and the accuracies, calibration, and other metrics were compared. 
	
**Contribution statement**: 
Weixun and Yiming implemented and evaluated the performance metrics for A1;

Marvin and Ananya implemented and evalueated A6;

Sibo and Weixun worked on the description of both algorithms;

Ananya is the presenter and worked on the outlines and scripts of the presentation, Marvin, Weixun and Yiming added to the content of the slide.
