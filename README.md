+ Project summary: This project explores two different methods for fairness in ML. A1 refers to LFR (Learning fair representations) and A6 refers to Local Massaging/Local Preferential Sampling. Our implementation for each algorithm can be found under the doc folder. For each of these algorithms, the algorithms were run on a COMPAS dataset and the accuracies, calibration, and other metrics were compared.
